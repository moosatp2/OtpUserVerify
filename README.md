# OtpUserVerify

# README

## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of user sign-in using a phone number and OTP (One-Time Password). The system allows a user to sign in by verifying their phone number through an OTP.

## How It Works

1. **User Model**: Contains `username`, `phoneNumber`, and `isVerified` properties.
2. **UserService**: Provides methods for signing in and verifying the user using a phone number and OTP.
